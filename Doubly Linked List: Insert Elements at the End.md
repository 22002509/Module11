# ðŸ“š Doubly Linked List: Insert Elements at the End of a Doubly Linked List

This Python program demonstrates the creation and manipulation of a **Doubly Linked List** where elements can be inserted at the **end** of the list. The program also provides a method to traverse the list and display the elements.

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim

To write a Python program that:
- Implements a **Doubly Linked List**.
- Allows insertion of elements at the end of the list.
- Provides functionality to traverse the list and display its elements.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm

1. **Step 1:** Define a class `Node` to represent each node in the doubly linked list with attributes:
   - `item` for storing the data of the node.
   - `nref` for storing the reference to the next node.
   - `pref` for storing the reference to the previous node.

2. **Step 2:** Define a class `DoublyLinkedList` with:
   - `start_node` to point to the first node of the list.

3. **Step 3:** Define methods in the `DoublyLinkedList` class:
   - `insert_in_emptylist(data)` to insert an element when the list is empty.
   - `insert_at_end(data)` to insert elements at the end of the list.
   - `traverse_list()` to traverse the list and print the elements.

4. **Step 4:** Create an instance of `DoublyLinkedList` and use the `insert_at_end()` method to insert elements into the list.

5. **Step 5:** Use the `traverse_list()` method to print the elements of the list.
