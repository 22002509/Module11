# 📝 Doubly Linked List: Search an Element

This Python program demonstrates the implementation of a **Doubly Linked List** where you can insert elements at both the beginning and the end of the list. Additionally, it allows you to search for a specific element in the list.

## 🎯 Aim

To write a Python program that:
- Implements a **Doubly Linked List** with functions to insert elements at the beginning and the end of the list.
- Implements a search function to check if a given element exists in the list.

## 🧠 Algorithm

1. **Step 1:** Define a class `Nodeq` with:
   - `data` to store the node's value.
   - `next` to store the reference to the next node.
   - `prev` to store the reference to the previous node.

2. **Step 2:** Define a class `DoublyLinkedList` with:
   - `head` to point to the first node.

3. **Step 3:** In the `DoublyLinkedList` class, define methods:
   - `insert_beginning(data)` to insert a node at the beginning.
   - `insert_end(data)` to insert a node at the end.
   - `search(data)` to search for an element in the list.

4. **Step 4:** Create an instance of `DoublyLinkedList`.
   - Insert elements at the beginning and end.
   - Search for specific elements.
